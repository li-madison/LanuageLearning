It takes some very special qualities to\n\nthis harsh landscape. But if you are lucky\nenough to visit here, you will find that no matter how\nalike the penguins seem, each one is different - and\nall of them are special.\n\nWe hope that by learning about these amazing\nanimals, future generations will want to protect\n‘them as much as we do.\n\nHAG\n\nRe"
